How syringe.sh works...

All secrets are encrypted... Secrets are encrypted on your machine before being sent to... Nobody else, including us, can decrypt and read your secrets.

Encryption is tied to your SSH key. If you lose your SSH key, that's it... You can upload multiple SSH keys...

Supported key formats:
  ‚úì RSA
  ‚úì OpenSSH
  ‚úó SomeOther`,

		Example: `  ‚Ä¢ Add a project
    syringe project add my_cool_project

  ‚Ä¢ Add an environment
    syringe environment add -p my_cool_project dev

  ‚Ä¢ Add a secret
    syringe secret set -p my_cool_project -e dev SECRET_KEY secret_value

  ‚Ä¢ List secrets
    syringe secret list -p my_cool_project -e dev

  ‚Ä¢ Inject secrets into command
    syringe inject -p my_cool_project -e dev -- startserver
